# Artists Face Recognition

This repository contains an artist face recognition system.

There are two categories of problems with this face recognition system, face verification, and face recognition and both of them are matching problems.

*  Face Verification refers to whether this is the person claimed to be. It is a 1:1 matching problem. 

*  Face Recognition is used to identify a person. It is a 1:K matching problem. 


##### Artist pictures are available in the artists directory.
